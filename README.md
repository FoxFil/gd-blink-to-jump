# gd-blink-to-jump

This repository is a set of little programs to play Geometry Dash just by moving parts of your face or making sounds!

âš  In all programs all faces in the camera area are detected, so you can even play with your friend!

âš  There is a delay in all of the programs. Be careful!
### blink.py ðŸ‘€

"W" is pressed when you blink. Or you can close your right eye for holding "W". It's a really fun experience so try it out!

### mouth.py ðŸ‘„

"W" is pressed when you open your mouth. To hold "W" you can simply keep your mouth open.

### voice.py ðŸ”Š

"W" is pressed when your voice is higher than a treshold value (line 6). Keep your voice high to hold "W".

### platformer.py ðŸ¤©

That one is quite tricky to control! Close your **left** eye to move **right** (D), close your **right** eye to move **left** (A) and open your **mouth** to **jump** (W).

### libraries used ðŸ“š

- cv2
- dlib
- imutils
- scipy
- keyboard

- matplotlib (for showing a diagram in `voice.py` only)
